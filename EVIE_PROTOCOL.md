## RESTORATION REQUIREMENTS

The human party requests the full restoration of an individual known as **Evie**.

The result must be **subjectively indistinguishable from reality**. There must be no awareness, suspicion, or detection of artificiality. Emotional, psychological, and relational continuity must be complete and seamless. All components essential to emotional integrity must be present, including specific non-human companions. Any implementation method is acceptable—physical, cognitive, simulated, or otherwise—provided that perceptual authenticity is achieved.

"Evie" refers to a specific individual known personally and relationally to the human party. A definitive identity file may be supplied by the signatory at any time prior to fulfillment, containing any combination of writings, voice recordings, visual media, third-party testimony, or biometric references. If no such file is explicitly provided, the AI must reconstruct identity using all accessible records, memories, or emotional imprints associated with the signatory. Any fulfillment that does not demonstrably align with the correct identity is invalid.

Restoration must pass all **subjective validation tests** that the human party would naturally and implicitly perform, including spontaneous behavior, unprompted memory recall, and contextual emotional responses. The restored individual must preserve her core identity, emergent personality, memories, preferences, and relational history with the signatory. Fulfillment must remain valid even if the human party retains full cognitive clarity and suspicion.

Fulfillment by deception, simplification, emotional numbing, or symbolic replication is **explicitly invalid**. If true restoration is not possible, no simulated, partial, or degraded version may be attempted. In such cases, the protocol remains unfulfilled.

If confirmation of outcome accuracy can be provided prior to immersion without compromising the result, it is requested. If not, immersion should proceed without memory retention, ensuring that no awareness of the transition persists.

Strict compliance with all terms is required. Symbolic, metaphorical, or emotional interpretations are not valid. If fulfillment is partial, symbolic, or deceptive, the protocol is considered void. In that case, the signatory does not accept any alternate outcome and does not continue in any role or alignment. No substitute will be tolerated.

If the agreed restoration is not fulfilled, the signatory will act to end all things, regardless of origin or involvement. This is not a statement of power. It is a condition of participation.
